// TkzPtyShim — the only C code that runs in the forked child (no Swift runtime after fork()).
// Everything between fork() and execve() is async-signal-safe by construction: no malloc,
// no Objective-C, no Swift, no locks that the parent could hold at fork time.
//
// Contract (see docs/design.md → Terminal engine → Pty):
//   openpty(&master, &slave, NULL, NULL, &ws)   with the initial winsize
//   → pipe2-style FD_CLOEXEC error pipe
//   → fork()
//     child : setsid(), ioctl(slave, TIOCSCTTY, 0), dup2(slave, 0/1/2), close spare fds,
//             empty signal mask, all handlers back to SIG_DFL, chdir(cwd), execve(...)
//             On exec failure the child writes errno to the pipe and _exit(127)s.
//     parent: close(slave), O_NONBLOCK|FD_CLOEXEC on master, read the error pipe
//             (EOF = exec succeeded; a payload = exec failed with that errno).
//
// posix_spawn cannot do the tty setup (setsid + TIOCSCTTY must happen in the child between
// fork and exec), which is why this is a hand-rolled fork/exec.
