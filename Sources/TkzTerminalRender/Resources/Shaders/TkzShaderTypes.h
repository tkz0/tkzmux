// TkzShaderTypes — structs shared byte-for-byte between Swift (TkzTerminalRender) and Metal
// (Resources/Shaders/Terminal.metal). Header-only; compiled by all three of:
//
//   1. `swift build`                       — as C, imported into Swift as module `TkzShaderTypes`
//   2. `xcrun metal -I Sources/TkzShaderTypes/include`  (scripts/make-app.sh → default.metallib).
//      Note that a quoted `#include` searches the *including file's* directory first, so what that
//      command actually picks up is the bundle copy sitting next to Terminal.metal; the `-I` is the
//      belt-and-braces fallback. The two files are byte-identical and a test enforces it.
//   3. `device.makeLibrary(source:)`        — the runtime fallback when default.metallib is absent
//      (`swift run` / `swift test`). That path has NO include search paths, so the loader
//      concatenates this header's text in front of Terminal.metal's text. Terminal.metal wraps its
//      `#include "TkzShaderTypes.h"` in `#if !defined(TKZ_SHADER_TYPES_H)`, which is why this file
//      uses a classic include guard and NOT `#pragma once` — `#pragma once` sets no macro, so the
//      guard in Terminal.metal could not tell that the header was already textually present and the
//      runtime preprocessor would try (and fail) to open a file that is not on disk next to it.
//
// A byte-identical copy of this header therefore ships inside TkzTerminalRender's resource bundle,
// at `Sources/TkzTerminalRender/Resources/Shaders/TkzShaderTypes.h`. It has to be a real copy and
// not a symlink: SwiftPM's `.copy(...)` reproduces symlinks verbatim into
// `.build/<triple>/debug/tkzmux_TkzTerminalRender.bundle/`, where the relative target no longer
// resolves (`.build/debug` is itself a symlink, so the link is one directory level off). The test
// `bundledHeaderIsIdenticalToThisOne` in ShaderCompileTests.swift byte-compares the two, so:
//
//     EDITING THIS FILE? re-run
//       cp Sources/TkzShaderTypes/include/TkzShaderTypes.h \
//          Sources/TkzTerminalRender/Resources/Shaders/TkzShaderTypes.h
//     or `swift test --filter TkzTerminalRenderTests` will tell you to.
//
// Layout rules
// - Every field is a fixed-width integer, a float, or a `simd` vector type. No `int`/`long`/`bool`.
// - `_Static_assert`s at the bottom pin `sizeof`, `alignof` and every `offsetof`. They are compiled
//   by the C compiler AND by both Metal compilers, and `Tests/TkzTerminalRenderTests/
//   ShaderCompileTests.swift` asserts the very same literals through `MemoryLayout`. A layout
//   divergence between Swift, C and Metal is therefore a build/test failure, never a corrupt frame.
// - Colours are packed `uint32_t`, byte order R,G,B,A from the low byte (see `tkz_unpack_rgba`
//   in Terminal.metal; Swift builds them with `r | g << 8 | b << 16 | a << 24`).
//   They are *straight* (non-premultiplied) sRGB-encoded 8-bit values — exactly what
//   `TkzCore.RGB` holds. The shaders premultiply on output.
//
// Coordinate conventions
// - Pixel space = device (backing) pixels, origin top-left, +y down. This is `[[position]]` in the
//   fragment shaders and the space `viewportSizePx` / `gridOriginPx` / `TkzRectInstance` live in.
// - Grid space = (column, row), origin top-left. Cell (c, r) covers the pixel rect
//   `gridOriginPx + (c, r) * cellSizePx` … `+ cellSizePx`.
// - Atlas space = texels, origin top-left. Both atlases are sampled with `coord::pixel`, so the
//   atlas dimensions in `TkzUniforms` are informational only and a regrow cannot desync UVs.
//
// See docs/design.md → Terminal engine → Metal renderer. M1.5 / TKZ-11.
