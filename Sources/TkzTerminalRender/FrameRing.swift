// The per-surface instance-buffer ring (TKZ-36).
//
// The renderer used to own a single 3-deep ring, which was right while exactly one surface was
// ever encoded per tick. With split panes it is not: N panes take N slots from the same ring in
// one tick, so a fourth pane blocks the **main thread** on `inflight.wait()` until the GPU has
// finished frame N-3. Deepening the ring only moves that wall, and leaves every pane's buffers
// sized to the largest pane on screen.
//
// So the ring belongs to the surface. Each pane gets three slots of its own, sized to its own
// content, and `TerminalSurface.detach()` drops the whole ring — which is what keeps "an
// unattached terminal costs only IO" true when a hidden tab's panes are torn down. That is
// strictly better than before, where the shared ring never shrank back from the widest frame it
// had ever drawn.
