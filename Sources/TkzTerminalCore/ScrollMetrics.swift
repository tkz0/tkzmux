// ScrollMetrics.swift — the terminal's scroll position, as a pure value (TKZ-45).
//
// libghostty maintains `{total, offset, len}` for exactly this purpose, and `vt/terminal.h` is
// explicit about how it must be consumed:
//
//     There is intentionally no change notification for scroll state. Callers building scrollbars
//     should poll this once per frame or per write batch and diff the result to detect changes;
//     this is what Ghostty's own renderer does.
//
// So this type is a *snapshot*, not a subscription. `FrameBuilder.update` reads one per frame
// inside the terminal lock it already takes for `begin_update`, and the view diffs the result —
// see `ScrollIndicator.swift` in TkzTerminalView for why that is the only shape that survives
// M1.6's idle guarantee.
