// DisplayLinkDriver — the parked-unless-there-is-work frame clock (M1.6 / TKZ-12).
// See docs/design.md → Terminal engine → View & input.
//
// The whole point of tkzmux's renderer is that an idle terminal costs nothing: the renderer's skip
// path returns *before* `nextDrawable()`, so as long as the display link itself is paused when
// there is no work, an idle window holds no drawable and burns no CPU.
//
// "Is there work?" is therefore the single most important decision in the view layer, so it is
// factored out of AppKit entirely: `DisplayLinkPolicy` is a pure function of `DisplayLinkDemand`
// and unit-tests without a window, a screen or a run loop. `DisplayLinkDriver` is the thin AppKit
// half: it owns the `CADisplayLink`, applies the policy's verdict, and logs every transition.
//
// A driver with no adopted link is fully functional (it just has nothing to pause), which is what
// lets the headless tests drive the exact same decision code the app runs.
