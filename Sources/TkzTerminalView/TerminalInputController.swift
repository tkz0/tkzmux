// TerminalInputController — NSEvent → `KeyPress` → pty bytes (M1.7 / TKZ-13).
// See docs/design.md → Terminal engine → *View & input* → **Keyboard**, and docs/keys.md.
//
// This is the single `TerminalViewInputDelegate`: it owns the keyboard and IME, and forwards every
// mouse/scroll event to a `TerminalMouseHandling` (TKZ-14) without interpreting it.
//
// ## What lives here and what deliberately does not
//
// Nothing here encodes anything. The controller builds a `KeyPress` — plain data, no AppKit — and
// hands it to `TerminalSession.encodeKey(_:optionAsAlt:)` on the view's visible session, which is
// where the libghostty call happens, under the session lock. (The `encodeKey` property overrides
// that for tests and for a host with no `TerminalSession`.) That keeps every C call inside the
// files docs/design.md lists, and makes the whole `NSEvent` → `KeyPress` translation — the part that
// is actually subtle — unit-testable with a synthesized `NSEvent` and no window, no pty and no
// terminal.
//
// Key bytes come *back* from the session and go out through `writeInput`. Pasted and IME-inserted
// text is the opposite: `ghostty_terminal_paste` writes it through the session's own pty sink, so
// this file must never also write it — that would send every paste twice.
//
// The one exception is `encodeFocus`, which calls `ghostty_focus_encode` (`focus.h`). That function
// is pure: it takes an enum and a buffer, touches no terminal and needs no lock, so keeping it here
// costs nothing and avoids a seam through Core for two bytes.
//
// ## The option-as-alt trap (verified M1.7, see docs/design.md)
//
// libghostty computes `effectiveMods = mods − consumedMods` whenever `text` is non-empty. Building
// the press the obvious way — take `event.characters` (`∫`) and report Option as consumed — encodes
// `∫` even with `MACOS_OPTION_AS_ALT` set. When Option acts as Alt the key must be translated
// *without* Option, so `text` is `"b"` and Option stays **unconsumed**; the encoder then sees `alt`
// in the effective mods and emits `ESC b`.
//
// That is what `translationEvent(for:optionAsAlt:)` is for, and it also has to be the event the
// *input context* sees: AppKit would otherwise commit `∫` through `insertText` before we ever get to
// build a press. Ghostty solves the same problem with `ghostty_surface_key_translation_mods`, an
// apprt API libghostty-vt does not export — `KeyEncoder.translationModifiers(for:optionAsAlt:)`
// reimplements it.
