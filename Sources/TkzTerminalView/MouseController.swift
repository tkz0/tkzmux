// MouseController — the AppKit half of mouse reporting, selection, clipboard, scrolling and OSC 8
// links (M1.8 / TKZ-14). See docs/design.md → Terminal engine → *View & input* → Mouse.
//
// Everything that needs a decision lives here; everything that needs libghostty lives behind
// `MouseControllerTerminal`. That split is deliberate:
//
//   * the routing policy (report vs select, click granularity, wheel row accumulation, the link
//     scheme allow-list) is pure and unit-tests against synthesized `NSEvent`s,
//   * the terminal side is one narrow protocol, so the tests can drive a *real* libghostty
//     terminal through it without a `TerminalSession`, a pty or a window.
//
// ## What this file does NOT do
//
//   * it never touches a `Pty`. Report bytes go out through `sendBytes`, which the input
//     controller wires to the session; paste bytes are produced *inside* libghostty and leave
//     through the terminal's own WRITE_PTY sink.
//   * it never clears `surface.needsDisplay`; it only ever calls `frameDriver.requestFrame()`.
//   * it does not consume `session.events`. `handle(_ event: TerminalEvent)` is called by whoever
//     owns that stream, for the OSC 52 `.clipboardWrite` case.
